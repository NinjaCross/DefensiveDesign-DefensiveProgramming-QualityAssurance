# Practical Defensive Design, Defensive Programming, and Quality Assurance principles
This repository contains some of the code samples, diagrams and materials of the book _["Practical Defensive Design, Defensive Programming and Quality Assurance principles"](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0FTMRDW33)_

**Defensive Design**, **Defensive Programming** and **Quality Assurance** are vast, multi-faceted, complex topics with deep historical roots and significant ramifications across multiple aspects of IT.

**Defensive Programming** is a software development technique designed to improve the robustness and reliability of code. It’s about anticipating potential problems and implementing safeguards to prevent them, in order to improve, and potentially guarantee, User Safety, Cybersecurity, System Integrity, Privacy and Data Confidentiality.

**Defensive Design** is its counterpart at a higher abstraction level, and involves creating infrastructures and architectures able to host and run code created with the Defensive Programming principles. As the two faces of the same medal, they both involve many different aspects of programming and different strategies, depending on the kind of application, and the technologies used to create it.

**Quality Assurance** is the means by which a consistent and unified work methodology is achieved for all its principles. Defensive Design, Defensive Programming and Quality Assurance are practically inseparable; one cannot be effectively maintained long-term without the other.
